# python_codes

this is some of the programs i type 4 learning/practsing or jsut 4 fun , thay might include wrong speling and back codes but i realy dont consider any of it as a proftnal work.
also u might find some of it unfinshed or full with errors cuz here is where i write all of my python code mostly.
feel free 2 use any of it if u could undstand it XD
thats all , and have a good day :D
